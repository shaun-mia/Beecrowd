# Becrow Problem Solving

Welcome to my repository dedicated to solving algorithmic and data structure problems from the **Becrow** problem-solving platform. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions, written for practice, learning, and preparation for competitive programming and technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

Each folder or file is named based on the problem title or ID on Becrow and includes:
- **Problem Name**
- **Description or Link (if available)**
- **Language Used** (Python, C++, Java, etc.)
- **Solution Code**
- **Time and Space Complexity (optional)**

## Problem-Solving Topics

This repository includes problems covering:
- Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Stacks, Queues, etc.)
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Greedy, Divide & Conquer, etc.)
- Graph Theory (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Math & Number Theory
- Strings & Pattern Matching

## Folder/File Naming Convention

```
Becrow/
│
├── 001-Problem-Name.py
├── 002-Another-Problem.cpp
└── README.md
```

## My Goal

I aim to regularly solve problems and improve my problem-solving and coding skills. Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or challenge me with more problems.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/becrow-problem-solving.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder and open the solution files.

3. Run the code using your preferred IDE or compiler.
